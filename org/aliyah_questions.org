* what is Bayit Rishon BeMoledet and how can I get there? is it the same as an absorption center?

* how do I find a kibbutz that will accept me?

* When can I apply to a university? What is the general situation there? How desirable am I as a student? As an assistant professor?

* Can I get state assistance for starting a business? How does that work?

I'm at the ministry of absorption center and it's been nice but I'm somewhat irked by everything. So far I've been told that I'm not a real jew because halacha 'n stuff. They've also made an awful, awful awful photo of me. And told me that I can't take on a Hebrew name right here and then and that I should do that in the ministry of interior some other day instead. Okay. More time to gestate and research if nothing more.
