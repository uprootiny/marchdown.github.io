I will have to fend for myself now. I don't know how though. I want things.
I want material things so I will have to work and adapt. I things immaterial,
aesthetic, intellectual. So I'll have to put myself out there and connect with people. This is scary for me. I'm so used to being somehow incomplete /not quite enough/. I am embarassed, I feel guilty about being suicidal sometimes. Like life is too hard and incomprehensible. Burdensome. Pointless. As if every good thing I do or experience or put out there in the world is inconsequential and way too dearly bought. Nothing costs anything.


I am not a playah. I need a job. I need a personal project, a vision. I need... myself, really. I do need myself. I might pretend for a while until I grow myself.

Setting goals. Setting goals is important. When I tried to use Complice, I was overwhelmed by *how much stuff* I wanted to do. No way to fit it into a day or a week. Plus, it does not really /support/ me. It's unsustainable. I have to start from the very beginning.

I need a way to make money. /Then/ I need a profession (isn't that putting a carriage before the horse?)

Well. Tomorrow things'll seem clearer.
