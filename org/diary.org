I've slept some. Woke up, made tea and toast. Did a Hebrew typing practice session. 

I should keep my budget. I've decided on using google spreadsheets so far. I'll move on to something better -- YNAB, probably, once I've got income.
* <2017-03-02 Thu 21:17> Plan for now
** Walk. Maybe even run. Come back home or sit at some cafe. (now I wish I had taken my trashy sweatshirt with me.) Meditate. Work through some articles
https://akshatm.svbtle.com/consistent-hash-rings-theory-and-implementation 
seem nice. Consider getting on Mokum or Tumblr. That would be a good habit to get into. Think. Write. Maybe find a gathering a go there. Sleep. Try again tomorrow.

In general i should take care of feeling good about myself and from that state work on things. Now I have ideas of what to do at my computer: find startups, trawl lesswrong, avva.lj.ru, twitter, okc, classifieds, but I am getting crummy and should really get out and walk or run and meditate and just get in better touch with myself.
** TODO make my shoes not smelly
** DONE try running and meditating and see whether it works for me.
Did work nicely, but I'm still wired. That means that caffeine's out and Remotiv's in for now.
** <2017-03-04 Sat 14:04>
I am becoming the thing I hate.
I spend hours at my computer feeling sorry for myself and not lifting a finger to make things better.

OK, so the plan for now. Have breakfast and read some. Charge my phone. Then go to Aroma or someplace else, take a Chai Latte, sit down and focus. List my resources. Whom to contact Where to seek employment - help, advice, suggestions, anything. Study. Duolingo, HR, Coursera. Write down absorption busywork checklist.


Resources:
LW (avva, benjamin, forums)
Mokum (kukutz, linorg?)
Maya Geller.
Various Startup events, social outings, cocktail parties, public lectures.
Kanel: U of Haifa prolly.
Meeyersohn.
EA?
Ashka. Kirvas. Olya fix. Mike Nazarov. Polonsky.

I walked for a while, sat on the beach, and have now settled in a nice place called "Olive Korner" on טבריה street. 

I woke up at around 13 hours with a stuffy head. Everything feels unbearably rough, sharp and heavy. I went for a run first thing

I wonder if its possible to relegate the Halting Problem to the realm of theoretical curiosa by drawing guidelines of how algorithms should be implemented so that their termination is almost always feasibly provable.

recap: I've been to my father's, I've spoken w/G about her visiting me soon-ish and her mother seems to object which makes us both sad, I've been offered a job but then they sorta kinda disappeared.

** Things on my mind now: G, kids, job search, DuoLingo, Sports, Dances, AWS something-or-another, Ethereum, meetups, meeting J & D.

** By the way of learning hebrew, there are some phrases I'm grasping for. Such as:
 - Do You mind if I...
 - Do you happen to know whether...
 - How much; כמה
 - I do not understand
 - Could you repeat that slowly please
 - How do you say...
 - What does ... mean?
 - I would like to...
 - Would you help me out with..
 - Do you need a hand with that?
 - Do you need help with...?
 - Do you want some...?
 - May I offer you...?
 - Have you seen...?
 - Do you know...?



Plus there are things that I might want to say but I don't know yet that I want to say them. Something that would build up towards positive and efficient communication. Compliments. Offers.

** Other things that might help.
- writing out scripts. I've had several nice conversations with bus drivers. There are pretty typical things I would ask and tell. I might compose them in advance and then practice.
- Practice scripts from the textbooks: at a cafe, in a bank. Dance classes. Job interview.
- Practice /typing/ from a list of common words and frases until they become ingrained in my muscle memory.

** Today
Call up Rina. Dinah, too. Check up on that AWS thing. Look for more events online. 
Study. Do some more DuoLingo. Study Ethereum. Research jobs. Consider sending someone a resume, tentatively. Play HackerRank. get back on Interviewing.io.

I didn't accomplish anything yesterday. 
Wait, that's not right. I made motions to go to the bank and the ministry but I was too spaced out. I forgot my passport and went back to fetch it, by the time I've got it it was too late. But that's not the most important thing. I only need that for the money and I still have some. There are more things that happened:

I went to the AWS gathering. 
I've introduced myself to several people there. I've made some useful connections. I saw that it's not as scary as I felt it would be.
I've met with J. That was nice. We went for a long walk and made fascinating conversation. I'm staying at her place as I type. I feel somewhat better.
** Things I want to do or, as they might be called in the relation to each other, /distractions/
- The most high-impact thing I could do right now:
-- write and begin sending out my resume
-- call Katz. Talk about our gripes, differences and the common vision.
-- prep for meetings
- pick a new name. Get passport. Make myself a website, a new email address. It would be easier to connect with people. My public identity would be /stickier/, shinier and easier to handle.
- study Hebrew.
- Study math.
- Study history, yiddish poetry & all that jazz.
- Go for walks. Run. Bike. Visit museums.
- Get on CouchSurfing. Write people on OKC.
** Software projects
- ICE
- learn Ethereum
- learn AWS
- contest ethereum bounty
- play around on hackerrank
- study Zack's oracles

I don't want to do anything. I don't want to interact with people. I just want to curl up with a book. I feel that I should go do somethign. Alright. How about leaving in the morning together with Julia. 
*** What were all these things I wanted to do but didn't? Hebrew. Books. OKC. CouchSurfing. Code! A lot of code. Music. People. Getting a psychiatrist.
*** <2017-03-22 Wed 18:06> Damn everything. I'm going for a walk. With an iPad. I'll huddle up somewhere and read, like, forever.

So I'm afraid of everyone and otherwise am not managing my life well. 
Things that might help.
Get a job, any job.
Go live in the desert. On a farm. Join the army. Work construction. Anything with a strict schedule imposed from the outside, exhausting physical work, lots of nature.

** Magical realism
Magical realism is... fitting. Appropriate. A sign of times you might say. People make up metaphors to explain their lives. Sometimes they stick. Sometimes people begin living out metaphors for their own sake.

Every night I purge myself. I barf out everything I've consumed during the day. I expel pieces of my identity that have stuck to the tender core of my being. I remain no one. Sometimes the pieces stick. They burden me, the /burn/ me from the inside. Sometimes, at the end of the day I am someone. It makes everything so heavy. Every move, every possible action blooms with considerations and consequences and I'm so light that I can't just stand my ground and take it like a champ that I ain't.
* TODO (!) Seek a sublet. Maybe I could stay with G at some place that would /remain/ mine once she leaves.
* TODO Research consumer psychiatry here. Contact @aalien. Inquire at the health insurance office.

* <2017-03-30 Thu 11:55> Today I got up four hours later than I expected.
I felt scared and tense. It was very hard to get out of bed. Once I was outside and, especially, at the table with a cup of coffee, things felt much better. They would have been better still if I had been there early. I may have miscalculated how much energy -- and attention -- I had to burn at night and run a deficit. I might have fallen asleep at 2 or even 3 AM. Which both leaves me little time to sleep and overloads me with all the information consumed in the four hours since I've left the hackathon.

* Post hackathon. 

** Read Bancor whitepaper

** Go through contact details and contact these people

** Whip up a CV and a page about myself

** Do a tumblr with algorithmic art

** Get a real phone and a facebook page.


* <2017-04-04 Tue 19:09>
I'm sitting in an Ethiopian cafe next to the train station in Tel Aviv. Shalma road. Where the dances are. I came in because they had a pyramid with an eye graffitied on a wall.

The week was hectic. Now is the time to reckon where things stand. While on a train I've read something that reminded me of GTD's concept of open loops. And the importance of keeping them out of mind. Thus I want to make a list of those and work from there.

** Open loops

*** Staying sane.
 - I almost always have less energy and clarity than I want and expect of myself.
 - I get overwhelmed easily. I don't have a good coping strategy. How /do/ I react though? This might be a good starting point.
 - I have tried medication and it went horribly. I'm almost ready to try again though.
 - I have tried lifestyle interventions and they worked. I feel that I haven't been consistent enought though. I don't expect them to suffice even if I adhere to them perfectly. I just feel sick. I need more than rest.
 - 
*** Money.
 - earning
 - investments
 - loans
 - taxes
*** Languages
*** Math
*** Hacking, open source contributions
*** Dance
*** Art
*** Socializing
*** Writing
*** Presense
*** Winding down. Meditation. Taking care of myself. Sports. Health checkups. Hygiene. 
* <2017-04-04 Tue 20:18>
I'm still at the Ethiopian place. I feel rushed. I wanted to go sit on a hill somewhere and meditate. Also find places to meditate inside.
** Plan for tomorrow.
** Get up early. Before noon. At sunrise, preferably. Go get my card from a bank. Get a phone contract. Go to Google Campus. Work. Work on exploring my options here. Make a mind map. Make a list of people I want to work with, talk with, places and opportunities to research further. Make a CV geared to them. Contact them. Make appointments. Write a review of the Bancor Whitepaper. Get more involved with blockchain.
