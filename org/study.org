** Diary entry
I'm working through [the Programming Languages class on coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/programming-languages/lecture/mYYPe/course-motivation-introduction)
and I have a lot of ideas popping up. Mostly things that seem like too much effort to actually implement, but hey may be cool to revisit, so I'll note them down here.

*** Do a music player in Elm

*** Do a stack of languages from assembly to something Haskellish

*** An overview of compiler paradigms

*** Birds-eye view on problems like LaTeX not having inline macros bindings

*** Doing algorithmic problems in functional-style C with function pointers.

*** Doing an LISP, compilers, or write-you-a-haskell tutorial

*** Digging deep into Haskell internals

*** Working with dependent typles

*** Doing a parser from the ground up, then another fifty.

*** Do HDCP

*** Do Fast.ai, fast.ai is good.

** <2017-09-25 Mon 06:18>
I'm doing streams. I wonder if I could do them in Haskell, Python, C....

Also also Racket works differently in Geiser than in DrRacket.
it does not like #lang directive
and the stream definition is wonky

** TODO work through the delay/force examples 
ideally coding as I go and staying one step ahead of the videos

** TODO redo the memoization example with immutable datastructures passing env as an argument.

** Complete the homework,

*** 9. 

*** 10. 

*** 11, challenge problem.

** 
** do an immutable memoized fibonacci in C

** What's this thing with hygienic macros

*** Variable renaming
** Have an assembly environment
Build it up from the *very* basics. MOV-machine?
I'm thinking some usable assembly, ARM probably, then LLVM, then... something a little on top of that. Then C. Then something haskell-ish.
